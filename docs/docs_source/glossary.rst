    Access Token
        A string used by the host to determine the identity and permissions of the issuer of the WOPI request.
        The token is generated by the host and passed to Office Online before the first WOPI request. The host passes
        the token to the Office Online application in the initiating request described in section 3.1.5.1.1.2.3.3.

        Office Online requires no understanding of the format or content of the token.

        The token should expire after a length of time deemed reasonable by the host.

        The token should only provide access to resources associated with the WOPI request. That is, the token should
        be scoped to a specific user and file.

    Broadcast
        A broadcast is a special Office Online scenario where navigation through a document is driven by one or more
        presenters. A set of attendees can follow along with the presenter remotely.

    File ID
        The File ID represents the file or folder being operated on by the WOPI client. A host must issue a unique
        id for any file used by Office Online.

    Host Frame
    Host Page
    Outer Frame
        The host frame (also called the 'host page' or 'outer frame') is the HTML page which will host an iframe that
        points to an Office Online application.

    Session Context
        The Session Context is an optional parameter that a host can include on a WOPI request. It is a **string**, and
        is passed to Office Online in the ``sc`` query string parameter. If included on a WOPI request, Office Online
        will return the value of ``sc`` as the value of the **X-WOPI-SessionContext** HTTP header when making
        the :ref:`CheckFileInfo` and :ref:`CheckFolderInfo` WOPI requests.
