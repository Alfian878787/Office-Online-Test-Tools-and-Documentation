    Access Token
        A string used by the host to determine the identity and permissions of the issuer of the WOPI request.
        The token is generated by the host and passed to Office Online before the first WOPI request. See
        :ref:`Action URLs` and :ref:`Passing access tokens securely` for more information about how this parameter
        should be passed to Office Online. See :ref:`Access token requirements` for a full description of the
        requirements of an access token.

    Broadcast
        A broadcast is a special Office Online scenario where navigation through a document is driven by one or more
        presenters. A set of attendees can follow along with the presenter remotely.

    File ID
        The File ID represents the file or folder being operated on by the WOPI client. A host must issue a unique
        ID for any file used by Office Online. See :ref:`Action URLs` for more information about how this parameter
        should be passed to Office Online. See :ref:`File ID requirements` for a full description of the
        requirements of a file ID.

    Host Page
    Host Frame
    Outer Frame
        The host page (also called the 'host frame' or 'outer frame') is the HTML page which will host an iframe that
        points to an Office Online application.

    Session Context
        The Session Context is an optional parameter that a host can include on a WOPI request. It is a **string**, and
        is passed to Office Online in the ``sc`` query string parameter. If included on a WOPI request, Office Online
        will return the value of ``sc`` as the value of the **X-WOPI-SessionContext** HTTP header when making
        the :ref:`CheckFileInfo` and :ref:`CheckFolderInfo` WOPI requests.
