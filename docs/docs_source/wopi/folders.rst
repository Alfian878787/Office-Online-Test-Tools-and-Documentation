Folders endpoint
================

..  include:: /fragments/deprecated_endpoint.rst

The Folders endpoint provides access to folder-level operations. This endpoint exposes the :ref:`CheckFolderInfo`
operation, which returns information about a folder, the permissions that the user has on that folder, and the
capabilities that the WOPI host has on the folder.

For general information about invoking WOPI operations, see :ref:`Executing WOPI operations`.
