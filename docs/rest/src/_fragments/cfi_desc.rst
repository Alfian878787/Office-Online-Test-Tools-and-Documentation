The CheckFileInfo operation is one of the most important WOPI operations. This operation must be implemented
for all WOPI actions. CheckFileInfo returns information about a file, a user's permissions on that file, and general
information about the capabilities that the WOPI host has on the file. In addition, some CheckFileInfo properties can
influence the appearance and behavior of Office Online.
