    Changes to production settings require time to make.

    Any changes to Microsoft-configured settings **will take 2-3 weeks to fully roll out to the production
    environment**. This includes changes to the :ref:`allow list`.

    The test environment, on the other hand, is generally updated with new settings within 24-48 hours.
